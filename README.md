# Empirical_project
This is the example directory structure that I would use for any empirical project. It also comes along with sample Stata code

* data: Read Only contains all the csvs and dta
* output: Write only contains all tables and graphs 
* stata: contains all the stata code in do files 
* temp: any temprary data files that need to be stored
